**Code Scan To Clipboard** scans barcodes and qr codes and copies the result to the clipboard. It is intentionally kept simple, but has a few cool features:

- Open Source
- Free
- No tracking, no ads
- No personal data is collected

The app uses the [ZXing Android Embedded](https://github.com/journeyapps/zxing-android-embedded) barcode scanning library for Android.
