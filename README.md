**Code Scan To Clipboard** scans barcodes and QR codes and copies the result to the clipboard. 

You can also create QR code, EAN-13 and Aztec Code images.

It is intentionally kept simple, but has a few cool features:

- Open Source
- Free
- No tracking, no ads
- No personal data is collected

The app uses the [ZXing Android Embedded](https://github.com/journeyapps/zxing-android-embedded) barcode scanning library for Android.
